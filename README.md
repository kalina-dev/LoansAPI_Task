.NET 9, Dapper, Bogus, SQlite, SQL, Open API
- two tables in Sqlite CreditRequests and Invoices were created, which have a 1-to-many relationship.
- a nomenclature table CreditStatus was created;
- the database and its tables are created every time when the application is initialized;
- the tables are filled with dummy data every time anew; Faker Bogus is used for this purpose;
- basic validations were applied when filling the data;
- a minimal APIs approach was applied, because it is applicable to APIs that do not contain many endpoints in them;
- a CORS approach is provided for the API, a global error handling is prepared, the API also uses https;
- two endpoints requested in the assignment are implemented;
- for completeness, basic CRUD operations are also applied to credits and invoices; they are not displayed as endpoints;
- Dapper is used for data processing;
- four unit tests are written to ensure the solution.
